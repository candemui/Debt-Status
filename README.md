# Debt-Status
This repository has two dashboards designed for a state client.
--Exhibition of the Analysis and Planning boards of 'cuitificación'.
--Exhibition of the evolution of Collection 2020-2021-2022.
And a document of the internal auditory that was made, with the results and changes to implement.
--Exposition of proposals for legal compliance.

For these two dashboards, the information used came from Excel tables that were pulled out of the client´s database, because I didn´t have a permit to access
and connect the db to the graphics.

--Exhibition of the evolution of Collection 2019-2020.
The design and colors were chosen to reflect the palette of coding language so that it was appealing to the IT team.

Because of legal restrictions, the dashboards appear as power points, where the name of the entity has been deleted and the data used to create the graphics is not available.
